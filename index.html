      <div class="para"><img src="assets/elections.jpg" alt="vote" class="imgn"></div> 
      <div class="para"><p>Kayunga district constituted by 3 constituencies namely; Bbaale, Ntenjeru North and Ntenjeru South constituencies has arguably registered significant changes in regards to development over the past years since the last 2021 elections.</p></div> 
      <div class="para"><p>Such improvements have been attributed to the respective representatives; Hon. Amon Lugolobi (MP Ntenjeru North), Hon. Nsanja Patrick (MP Ntenjeru South), Hon.Charles Tebandeke (MP Bbaale Constituency), Hon. Nantaba Aidah Elios (District woman MP) and the district local government leadership under the chairpersonship of Hon. Muwonge Andrew.</p></div> 
    </div> 
      <div class="container">
      <div class="para"><p>Nonetheless, the achievements registered during the current leadership has not silenced the zeal of competing candidates from stepping up to contest for the same positions in a bid to further serve the interests of Kayunga people.</p></div> 
      <div class="para"><p>Importantly to note, the previous 2021 Kayunga elections registered court complaints from a number of candidates who affirmed the electro process involved election irregularities such as vote rigging to mention but a few thus deemed the entire process null and void.</p></div> 
      <div class="para"><p>Aligning this into context, some candidates who lost the previous election but believe are the duly elected candidates given the electro process had been free and fair have already started to re-awaken their support base in a bid to re-claim their 2026 victory a head of time.</p></div> 
      <div class="para"><p>There have been shifts in gears for some candidates who lost last time, now vying for new positions while other competing candidates have retained the aspiration to vie for the same positions they contested for in the 2021 elections.  Never to forget, a number of new contestants have emerged, full of vocal confidence, vigor and enthusiasm to diligently serve the Kayunga people once elected.</p></div>
      <div class="para"><p>This gives insights into a seemingly competitive race come 2026. Given the emerging stiff competition, will the current leaders retain their seats? Ours is to follow closely and get you the updates.</p></div>
